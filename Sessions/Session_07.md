# Session 7: Mini Project 1

## Group Mini Project 1

Design a package that drives the robot between two designated points in a straight line with obstacle avoidance, and pick up an object at the second point. In this project the points are selected in a way that the robot doesnâ€™t need to pass any wall or red tapes. Note that distance between walls is 60 cm and obstacles are placed randomly.
